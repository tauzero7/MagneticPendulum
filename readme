* Quick usage guide


==============================================================

Installation:
-------------
You need Qt 4.8 installed. 

Please note that it might not work with Qt 5.X.

1.) Open mpsim_viewer.pro in QtCreator.
    In the "Projects"-Tab -> "Build Settings" deselect
	"Shadow build" for debug and release!
	
2.) Adjust mpsim_viewer.pro file

    -) If compute shader is available you can include
        DEFINES+=HAVE_COMP_SHADER

    -) To have access to all parameters include
        DEFINES+=EXPERT_MODE

3.) qmake

4.) make

5.) Windows only:
    To start MPSim via double-klick, you first have to copy
    the following files from your Qt bin-folder into the current
	folder where MPSim.exe is:
	  QtGui4.dll QtCore4.dll QtOpenGL4.dll 
	or you have to adjust your PATH variable to include the Qt
	bin-folder.

==============================================================

Quick usage guide:
------------------
When starting MPSim the "View2D" visualization is selected.

* Mouse control in the "View2D" window:
    - left button:  start trajectory
    - mid button:   clear trajectory
    - right button: move magnet

* The line width and the line color can be set within the 
  "Trajectory" window. The length of the trajectory is determined
  by the number of integration steps 

* If you press the play button (Ctrl+p) in the "Control" window, 
  the "magnet map" will be calculated. Each pixel of this map 
  represents an initial position of the pendulum bob and is
  colored corresponding to the magnet the pendulum bob will be
  attracted. This might take a few seconds.
  The longer the pendulum bob needs to reach its final position,
  the darker the color will be (controled via "TScale").
  Set TScale=0 to disable this temporal coloring.

* The position of a magnet (posX,posY) as well as its strength
  (alpha) and its color can be set also in the "Magnets" window.
  Please note that the magnet ID starts with '0'.
  The number of magnets can only be changed by means of a
  parameter file, see "config" folder.

* The damping factor of the pendulum can be set within the
  "Pendulum" window (default value: 1.0). 
  Here, you can also set the maximum elongation of the pendulum
  in degree (maxTheta, default value: 5.0).


* You can toggle between 2D- or 3D-view either by selecting
  the corresponding tab or by pressing Ctrl-1 or Ctrl-2, 
  respectively.

* Mouse control in the "View3D" window:
    - left button:   move around point-of-interest (POI)
    - mid button:    move POI along the z-axis
    - right button:  zoom in/out    
    - button + SHIFT:  move magnet or pendulum bob 

* Press 'i' within the "View3D" window to reset the view.

* Press the play button (Ctrl+a) in the "Animate" window to 
  animate the pendulum bob.

NOTE: 
If you move a magnet or change one of its parameters or you 
resize the window, press |<< in the "Control" window before 
restarting the calculation of the "magnet map".
